# About This Project

This whole project is intended to have 50 mini projects and each is supposed to be completed in a day. Along with the projects, the notes for each project will be recorded in this document.

## Notes

### Expanding Cards

- JavaScript:
  You can grab the items with a certain class with `querySelectorAll` and it puts all the elements with that class in `node list`

```JavaScript
const panels = document.querySelectorAll(".panel");

console.log(panels);

```

and it consoles the following

```JavaScript

NodeList(5) [dıv.panel.active, dıv.panel, dıv.panel, dıv.panel, dıv.panel]
0: dıv.panel.active
1: dıv.panel
2: dıv.panel
3: dıv.panel
4: dıv.panel
length: 5
__proto__: NodeList

```
